# Friedrich Kuhlau - Opus 88, No. 3

Sonatina in A Minor Op 88 No 3

This sonatina ('small sonata') has three movements:

  * Allegro con affetto
  * Andantino
  * Allegro burlesco (this score)

Allegro burlesco is a fun but somewhat demanding piece with three multi-octave chromatic 'rips'
for the intermediate piano player. To the layperson it can sound very virtuoso.

Kuhlau is regarded as good preparation for the demands of Beethoven's piano music.

There are some free scores about but in learning this piece, I found that measures 55 - 59 (generally
the hardest section for the right hand) were incorrect, and sometimes with fingering that was odd
(at least for me).
